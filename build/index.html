					Commodity Gap Analysis 2019

			<div class="sub-section-container content-only">
				<p>This edition of the Commodity Gap Analysis (CGA 2019) is the fifth in a series dating back to 2001. Over the last two decades the report has reflected the evolving priorities and questions of our community. The first two reports, in 2001 and 2009, focused on donor supported countries and predominantly public sector supplies. More recent iterations of the CGA have expanded this scope to cover a wider set of countries, and they have looked at users, quantities, and costs in both the public and private sectors. These reports have broadened our understanding of the wider market; yielded insights from retail data acquired from IQVIA, and, helped start conversations about what the future might hold as the community looks to meet the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
				<p>With this edition, we take a new approach. While this CGA presents similar findings&mdash;current spending, users, consumption quantities, costs and gaps&mdash;it does so in new ways that better position these findings to inform the critical discussions happening within our community.</p>
				<p>New analytical approaches allowed us to explore how spending, users, and costs vary across not only the public and private sectors, but within the private sector as well, offering greater visibility into the role of donor-subsidized products in the private sector.</p>
				<p>This edition also breaks new ground by offering a more nuanced understanding of different patterns in spending, use, and cost across the 135 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) comprising our analysis.<span id="ref-main1" class="inline-reference-marker">[1]</span> In order to highlight fundamental differences that can help inform future planning, we’ve segmented these countries into the World Bank’s categories of Gross National Income per Capita (GNI): low-income countries (LICs), lower-middle-income countries (L-MICs), and upper-middle-income countries (U-MICs).</p>
				<p>Lastly, we’ve extended the time horizon for this report to 2030 in order to help inform pressing conversations about how we plan for the future and set out strategies for reaching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
				<p>The issues at the center of this analysis are the issues that will define the new decade for commodity security: the relative role of the public and private sectors; the declining role of donors in commodity procurement; the prospects for increased financial support from country governments; the impact of subsidized supplies on the total market; the evolution of method choice, etc.</p>
				<p>The rich findings of this report help illuminate pertinent facts about the world today, and what changes may happen over the coming decade. From these results, five critical themes emerged, themes so important to the conversations about the future of our sector that we made one final departure from past CGA reports and structured the report itself around these themes.</p>
				<!-- Stylized list of the 5 report themes. -->
				<div class="theme-list-block">
					<div class="theme-block-heading">
						<div class="theme-heading-number">1.</div><div><h2 class="theme-block-title">Reduced, even stagnant donor funding in the decade ahead</h2></div>
					</div>
					<p class="theme-block-description">Conversations within the reproductive health community suggest that donor support for commodity procurement is declining and will likely continue to decline or, at best, remain stagnant in the decade to come. In the context of shrinking donor funding for commodities, it is important to understand the role donors play in different countries and what can be done to minimize the impact of limited funding on those women who need it most. Nearly half of spending within low-income countries comes from donors, and collectively the public sector accounts for 66% of spending. Looking across the three GNI groups, the role of the public sector&mdash;namely, the donor community&mdash;diminishes as income increases. Prioritizing donor funding amongst lower-income countries, therefore, will be critical, as will encouraging country governments to play a larger role in funding family planning commodities.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="theme-list-block">
					<div class="theme-block-heading">
						<div class="theme-heading-number">2.</div><div><h2 class="theme-block-title">Disctinct method mixes across the public and private sectors</h2></div>
					</div>
					<p class="theme-block-description">Both the public and private sectors play important roles, yet the composition of each is very different. While the public sector primarily provides long-acting and permanent methods, the private sector almost exclusively provides short-term methods. This means the two are not interchangeable. We must take caution in assuming that in the context of shrinking donor funding, the private sector can simply take the place of what donors are supporting. Work is needed to ensure that as the funding landscape shifts, women are still able to access a full range of contraceptive methods.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="theme-list-block">
					<div class="theme-block-heading">
						<div class="theme-heading-number">3.</div><div><h2 class="theme-block-title">The significant, yet variable, role of subsidy within the private sector</h2></div>
					</div>
					<p class="theme-block-description">The previous CGA sparked debate over the relative role of public sector funding within the private sector, specifically as a result of subsidized socially marketed products. Building on new data and insights shared by DKT, MSI, PSI, and SHOPS Plus, this report distinguishes between users who purchase supplies from private sector entities at subsidized prices and those who pay non-subsidized (market-value) prices. This allows us to present two different financing models: one that is purely market driven, the other that relies on support from the public sector. The results indicate that across the 135 LMI countries, only a small share of private sector users (12%) receive subsidized products. In terms of the three GNI groups, the subsidized (private sector) commodities play the largest proportional role within low-income countries. Conversely, non-subsidized private sector commodities play the largest role within upper-middle-income countries (where they account for half of all users).</p>
				</div>
				<div class="theme-list-block">
					<div class="theme-block-heading">
						<div class="theme-heading-number">4.</div><div><h2 class="theme-block-title">The relationship between the distribution of users and consumption costs</h2></div>
					</div>
					<p class="theme-block-description">The results of this analysis demonstrate that cost is not a function of use. Rather, consumption costs are influenced by a number of factors, such as frequency of units consumed for each method, differences in cost between methods, and the variation of the cost of each method from country to country. Brazil, for example, accounts for only 8% of users, yet makes up 30% of the total consumption cost. By contrast, India accounts for 30% of all users across the 135 LMIC but makes up only 7% of consumption costs. Understanding how the landscapes of use compare to those of cost can help ensure all women can make their own choice from a full range of contraceptive methods.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="theme-list-block">
					<div class="theme-block-heading">
						<div class="theme-heading-number">5.</div><div><h2 class="theme-block-title">The possibility of significant, yet uneven growth in the coming decade</h2></div>
					</div>
					<p class="theme-block-description">Over the coming decade, the total number of women using modern contraception will grow by more than 80 million. This growth, however, will not be evenly distributed across countries. Low-income countries will experience the most rapid growth in relative terms, while lower-middle-income countries will experience the largest increase in absolute terms. The efforts needed to sustain these different growth patterns will vary across countries, with some requiring additional money and effort than others.</p>
				</div>
				<p>Our community is at a pivotal moment: we are on the cusp of reaching 2020 and beginning to look towards reaching the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. The conversations and decisions that are made over the coming years will shape the future of contraceptive use and the landscape of reproductive health supplies. The critical themes and findings from this report can help inform and nuance these conversations. And, just as with the past reports, we hope that this CGA will solicit new questions that our next report can seek to answer.</p>

					<p>The new data and analytic approaches used in the CGA 2019 report have allowed us to unpack our spending estimates to examine variations within and among each GNI country group, sector, and source of funding.</p>
					<p>The amount currently spent on contraceptive supplies across the entire LMIC market is $3.33 billion. Over 80% of this amount&mdash;four out of every five dollars&mdash;comes from individuals purchasing supplies from private sector entities. Within the private sector, most supplies (80%) are sold at full commercial prices. Only a small percentage of supplies&mdash;just 2% ($46.7 million)&mdash;are sold at subsidized prices. These supplies are typically but not exclusively sold through social marketing agencies. The balance of spending comes from public sector sources, which include both donors and country governments. Governments, however, spend nearly three times more than donors.</p>

						The Impact of Donor Spending within GNI Groups
					</h3>
					<p>Within each GNI Group, there are pronounced differences in public versus private sector spending and thus the impact of donor spending also varies. The public sector accounts for the largest share of spending in low-income countries. This is related in large part to the contribution of donors, which accounts for nearly 50% of all spending in this GNI group. The remaining public sector spending&mdash;roughly 17%&mdash;comes from governments. Amongst lower-middle-income countries, public sector spending accounts for a relatively small share (6%) of total spending in large part as a result of declining donor support. But the increase in country government expenditures (to 29%) relative to that in low-income countries ensures that public sector spending remains significant overall. In upper-middle-income countries, the contribution of public sector resources is negligible: out-of-pocket purchases from private sector entities (92%) dominates all spending.</p>

					</div>
					The spending pattern in upper-middle-income countries is largely influenced by Brazil where private sector users of injectables, pills, and condoms dominate the market (60% of all users). Recent studies have suggested that limited availability of long-acting and reversible methods in the public sector even the private sector have contributed to this method skew.<span id="ref-box1-3" class="inline-reference-marker">[&dagger;]</span>
				</div>
				<p>While these patterns can easily be interpreted to imply some sort of natural, inevitable transition from public to private sector spending as country GNI increases, they are by no means a prescription for what the future holds. These patterns are all moments in time and representative of those countries currently falling within each GNI group today.</p>
				<p>There are also suggestions that the relatively smaller contribution of public sector expenditures within upper-middle-income countries may be specific to spending on contraceptive supplies. A wider analysis of health commodity expenditures suggests a potential resurgence of government spending not seen in this analysis among upper-middle-income countries.[23] This may be due to unique policy decisions about the role of public sector spending on contraception among some of the large upper-middle-income countries.</p>

					</div>
				</div> -->
				<p>Because the level of spending varies so much across GNI groups, it is useful to look at not only how things are distributed within GNI groups but also how spending by each sector is distributed across GNI groups. Overall, two-thirds of total spending comes from upper-middle-income countries, most of which is private sector spending (76%).</p>
				<p>More than half of government spending (54%) comes from lower-middle-income country governments. While government spending ($170 million) only makes up a small share (8%) of total spending in upper-middle-income countries, it represents 37% of total government spending</p>
				<p>Currently, donor funding appears to be well targeted towards those who need it most: nearly 60% of spending by donors on contraceptive supplies is spent to procure commodities for low-income countries, with most of the rest spent in lower-middle-income countries.</p>
				<p>These findings suggest that shortfalls in donor funding that may appear minor in the overall context could have a disastrous impact should they occur in low-income country group. At the same time, these findings also suggest that because of their larger revenue bases, governments in middle-income countries&mdash;both upper and lower&mdash;may be better positioned to provide funding for supplies and thus may be more capable of absorbing costs previously borne by donors.</p>

				<p>If the amount spent annually on contraceptive supplies remains at the current level while the number of women who need supplies continues to grow, a funding gap of $178 million will emerge in 2020. As the discrepancy between total consumption costs and the actual funding spent on supplies continues to grow, so will the funding gap, reaching $266 million in 2025 with the cumulative gap over five years (2021&ndash;2025) reaching $1.17 billion. A funding gap of this size could have devastating consequences for women who wish to prevent or delay pregnancy.</p>

				<p>Currently, women purchasing their own contraceptives from private entities make up the largest share of spending. Looking forward, this group will account for the largest share of the gap. The amount that will need to be spent out-of-pocket in the private sector will increase to $2.85 billion in 2025, meaning women will need to spend $144 million more than they currently do. Because of differential patterns of growth across countries, however, a smaller share of the cumulative gap (59%) is attributed to private out-of-pocket expenditure than the current share of spending attributed to this group (80%).</p>
				<p>The remaining 41% of the cumulative gap attributed to public sector entities ($481 million) is more than double the share of current public sector spending (19%). Because increases in consumption costs are concentrated in countries with a higher reliance on public sector funding, the gap will also be concentrated in these countries.</p>
				<p>Despite the fact that governments account for a larger share of current spending than donors they end up over the 2021&ndash;2025 period with a similar cumulative gap ($240 million versus $241 million). This is due to the differences in growth patterns between low-income countries, where donors account for the majority of public sector funding, and lower-middle-income countries, where governments account for the majority of public sector funding. Donors will thus need to increase their funding more than governments&mdash;in both relative and absolute terms&mdash;in order to maintain their share.</p>

					</div>
				</div> -->
				<p>A closer look at the different patterns of change in consumption costs within each GNI group provides a varied view of future funding gaps.[24] Because the total consumption cost is declining in upper middle-income countries, the gap in these countries will shrink over time; by 2025 the spending gap will equal only 1% of the cost share. On the other hand, low-income countries will incur the largest increase in consumption costs, thus causing the gap in these countries to grow the fastest. In 2020, low-income countries will have the smallest gap, representing 18% of the total cost share that year. By 2025, their gap will be the second largest nearly as large as that in lower-middle-income countries. By 2025, the gap will represent 37% of low-income countries’ total cost share. Therefore, in order to keep up with the growing needs in low-income countries, spending will need to grow much more rapidly relative to current spending levels.</p>

The remaining gap ($233 million) will be in low-income countries.</p>
					<p>Out-of-pocket by individuals from private entities accounts for the largest share of the cumulative gap within lower-middle-income countries (65%), as well as upper-middle-income countries (92%). In contrast, within low-income countries nearly half of the gap is attributed to donors.</p>

					<p>Currently, there are 467 million users of contraception living in the countries that constitute the low- and middle-income countries market for supplies. Overall, these users are almost equally split between LAPMs (sterilization, implants, and IUDs) and STMs (injectables, pills, condoms, and other methods): 232 million users of contraception rely on, while 235 million users of contraception consume. The predominant method of contraception in LMICs is sterilization; its 162 million users make up more than one-third of the total method mix. One in five users of contraception (91.8 million) consume pills, making it the second most popular contraceptive method in the LMIC market.</p>
					<p>When comparing the differences in method use between the public and private sectors, one can observe a division of labor of sorts, where the public sector plays a greater role in delivering long-acting and permanent methods (LAPMs), while private sector entities provide the majority of short-term methods (STMs). Injectables effectively straddle the divide: slightly more injectable users get their method from the public sector (37.4 million) than the private sector (32 million). Of the total number of users of contraception in LMICs, 57% (268 million) obtain supplies from the public sector while the remaining 43% (199 million) obtain their supplies from private sector entities.</p>
					<p>Within the public sector, two-thirds (67%) of users rely on LAPMs. By contrast, users of pills, injectables, condoms, and other modern methods—all STMs—make up 73% of the private sector method mix. This pattern seems to indicate that investments in healthcare facilities and staff training, combined with the potential to leverage economies of scale, give the public sector an advantage in providing LAPMs. Long-acting and permanent methods require a medical service, trained personnel to provide that service, and a discrete physical space in which the service can be provided. Short-term methods, especially pills and condoms, on the other hand, often require little more than a simple retail transaction. The dominance of short-term methods in the private sector may be a function of limits on what can be offered and by whom within private sector entities (such as drug shops) can offer due to their type of facility or level of provider. They may also be a function of the greater profit-making potential of methods that require re-supply.</p>

						Public versus Private Sectors within GNI Groups
					</h2>
					<p>Each of the three GNI country groups account for different numbers of contraceptive users in the total market. With 283 million users, lower-middle-income countries account for 61% of all users. Upper-middle-income countries account for 30% of users (139 million), while low-income countries account for only 10% (44.7 million).</p>
					<p>Government programs and policies, cultural norms, market strength, and other factors influence the level and type of contraceptive use in each country. As we observe patterns of contraceptive use and method mix in the global market, we should keep in mind that just four countries carry the same weight as the other 131 countries combined. Cumulatively, 49% of all users live in just four countries: India (30%), Brazil (8%), Indonesia (7%), and Bangladesh (5%). By contrast, 116 countries in the global market each account for less than 1% of the total number of users.</p>
					<p>Within low-income countries the most commonly used method is injectables, accounting for 36% of users (16 million). Fewer than half that number use each of the next most popular methods: 7.13 million women (16% of users) use pills and 6.65 million (15% of users) women use implants.</p>
					<p>In lower-middle-income countries, sterilization is the predominant method (43%), followed by pills (18%) and injectables (14%). Because this GNI group represents almost two-thirds of total users, combined with the fact that India—a lower-middle income country—represents such a large share of users compared to other LMIC countries, the overall LMIC method mix closely mirrors that of lower-middle-income countries.</p>
					<p>Within upper middle-income countries, sterilization is also the most prevalent method, but in it accounts for a much smaller share of overall use (27%). Pills and condoms each also make up roughly comparable shares of the method mix (25% and 21% respectively).</p>
					<p>Lower-middle-income countries are not only home to the largest number of users overall, but also to the largest number of both public sector users (116 million) and private sector users (166 million). In relative terms, however, the contribution of the public sector diminishes across each GNI group; it is the largest share in low-income countries (70%), and smallest in upper-middle-income countries (50%).</p>

					<p>While there are some differences in the private sector method mix across the three GNI groups, these differences are subtle. Between 70% and 75% of the private sector method mix in each income group is made up of just three methods: injectables, pills and condoms. The relative use of these three methods, however, varies. In low-income countries, condoms and injectables are the most common methods used by private sector users, while in lower- and upper-middle-income countries, pills are the most common method in the private sector.</p>
					<p>Within the public sector, however, the differences in method mix across GNI groups becomes more pronounced. For example, injectables account for 40% of the public sector method mix in low-income countries, but only 10% and 12% in lower- and upper-middle-income countries, respectively. We also see a much more pronounced role of implants within public sector users in low-income countries—19% compared to less than 5% in the other two GNI groups. In fact, despite many fewer public sector users in low-income countries compared to the other two GNI groups, in absolute terms there are more public sector implant users (5.88 million) living in low-income countries than in lower- or upper-middle-income countries (4.97 million and 2.5 million, respectively).</p>
					<p>A more significant difference emerges in the role of public sector sterilization. Within lower-middle-income countries nearly 60% of public sector users rely on sterilization compared to only 9% in low-income countries and 39% in upper middle-income countries.</p>
					<p>These differences suggest that shifting efforts from the public to the private sector as a strategy to deal with limited donor funding may not be feasible on its own. Along with cost barriers, such a shift may limit method choice in situations where private sector entities play a limited role in providing long-acting and permanent methods.</p>

					The Role of Subsidies in the Private Sector

				<div class="lede-text">
					<p>The previous CGA sparked debate over the relative role of public sector funding within the private sector, specifically as a result of subsidized socially marketed products. Building on new data and insights shared by DKT, MSI, PSI, and SHOPS Plus, this report distinguishes between users who purchase supplies from private sector entities at subsidized prices and those who pay non-subsidized (market-value) prices. This allows us to present two different financing models: one that is purely market driven, the other that relies on support from the public sector. The results indicate that across the 135 LMI countries, only a small share of private sector users (12%) receive subsidized products. In terms of the three GNI groups, the subsidized (private sector) commodities play the largest proportional role within low-income countries. Conversely, non-subsidized private sector commodities play the largest role within upper-middle-income countries (where they account for half of all users).</p>

				<p>Publication of the 2018 edition of the CGA offered our community greater visibility into private sector provision of contraceptive supplies. New data from IQVIA revealed the higher prices paid by those who secured their supplies through private sector entities. The CGA 2018 analysis applied these higher prices to a proportion of private sector consumption, recognizing that this sector comprised both subsidized and non-subsidized products. But it left an incomplete picture, in large part because uncertainties remained over the exact size the private market for of the subsidized and non-subsidized supplies. The 2018 edition of the CGA also treated the social marketing sector as a subset of the private sector when in fact the work of social marketing agencies straddled both the public and private sectors.</p>
				<p>This edition of the CGA breaks new ground by setting aside the distinctions between the social marketing and full commercial sectors, focusing instead on the supplies themselves: whether they are sold at full commercial price, or whether they benefit from some sort of public sector subsidy. For this analysis, who sells in the private sector is less important that the cost structure of what they sell.</p>

								Looking beyond subsidized commodities
							</h4>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>The CGA 2019 analysis of subsidy within the private sector is primarily focused on commodities themselves. However, discussions within the RHSC community have highlighted other approaches to applying subsidies within the private sector.</p>
					<p>The text below, provided by PSI, highlights their latest thinking on moving beyond a supply-side subsidy.</p>
					<p>Supply-side subsidy is frequently used to offset commodity costs to increase market inputs and ultimately reduce the price paid for commodities and services by the consumer. Subsidized commodities are important to the promotion of critical health seeking behavior by priority audiences, however, long-term reliance on subsidized commodities can impede market evolution when not managed thoughtfully.</p>
					<p>Market development requires a long-term view toward equitable growth and adaptation. Subsidy can be targeted at any point within a market to encourage critical market functions for growth, equity, quality, and sustainability. Decisions about where and how to target subsidy should ensure that priority audiences benefit equitably and that no individual players across the value chain, e.g. brands or providers, are inhibited or crowded out from performing key market functions. Market growth and equity often require subsidy that targets vulnerable groups by addressing specific obstacles that these groups face. Subsidy that reduces price across the market may not effectively increase use among youth for instance, unless other obstacles for access are recognized and addressed. Subsidy might better be used to promote youth-friendly services or provider behavior change. Targeting subsidy to correct specific market constraints strengthens the total market and creates resilience that eventually reduces reliance on donors.</p>
					<p>PSI has estimated that adjusting and increasingly targeting subsidy within a cost-recovery approach can move certain modern contraceptive markets from extrinsic donor dependency to sustainability within the short to medium term. Over that period, subsidy would need to be increasingly targeted to encourage new users and address obstacles for vulnerable users, including policy and the enabling environment.</p>
				</div>
				<p>Informed by data and insights from SMO actors and other private sector experts, the CGA 2019 is now able to tease out those circumstances where products received or purchased by individuals from private sector facilities were subsidized by either donors or country governments. Because of wide diversity in international NGO and SMO models for service delivery and product sales, only a subset of the supplies they distribute or services they provide fall into the classification of subsidized private sector- that proportion of their work where public sector funding reduces the price to users within the private sector.[25]</p>

					<p>Of the 199 million users of contraception who obtain supplies from private sector entities, 88% (174 million) purchase non-subsidized supplies. Overall, subsidized supplies play only a small role in low- and middle-income countries, largely due to the fact that most countries have no institutions (such as SMOs) through which subsidized products enter the private market. Among those that do, the size of the private market—which itself can vary greatly from country to country—often pales in comparison to the public sector.</p>
					<p>Of the 135 LMICs, only 49 have contraceptives available at subsidized prices within the private sector. Nonetheless, 24.5 million users of contraception do currently purchase supplies at subsidized prices from the private sector. And, at least for certain contraceptive methods, the role of subsidy is not insignificant: 32% of implant users and 23% of IUD users who get their method from private sector entities purchase subsidized products.</p>

Not surprisingly, the subsidized private sector plays the largest role in low-income countries, where 40% of private sector users purchase subsidized supplies. Within lower-middle-income countries the role of the subsidized private sector shrinks by about half, and virtually disappears within upper-middle-income countries. However, while the subsidized private sector plays a larger role within low-income countries, in absolute terms there are more users of subsidized supplies living in lower-middle-income countries (19 million versus 5.32 million) due to the larger number of users in this GNI group.</p>

				<p>Whether private sector users access subsidized or non-subsidized products has important implications for private sector consumption costs, since for any given method the subsidized price is lower than the non-subsidized price. Drawing on an expanded range of data sources country and regional estimates of both subsidized and non-subsidized private sector prices have been incorporated into the consumption cost analysis.

				<p>Comparing the subsidized and non-subsidized private sector price within each region gives a sense of the magnitude of the subsidy. Overall, injections have the lowest subsidy. Those who consume subsidized products (subsidized users) from private sector entities pay on average 31% of the non-subsidized price. IUDs and pills both have the greatest subsidy, with subsidized users paying less than 5% on average of the non-subsidized price. Subsidized implants are on average priced at 12% of the non-subsidized price, however only a quarter of implant users purchase their methods from private entities.</p>

					<p>Across low-and-middle-income countries only 2% of private sector costs come from spending on subsidized commodities. While this may seem small, it still equates to a total of $46.7 million. And for many of the women purchasing these subsidized supplies, especially those in the poorest countries, these products may have been unaffordable at higher prices.</p>
					<p>Supplies from private sector entities plays the largest relative share within low-income-countries. In this GNI group, subsidized supplies account 40% of private sector users but only 16% of private sector costs. The discrepancy can be attributed differences in prices paid between subsidized and non-subsidized products and differences in method mix. Like with users, the largest absolute costs from subsidized supplies comes from lower-middle-income countries ($36.6 million). However, in this GNI group, only 6% of private sector costs derive from users purchasing subsidized supplies.</p>
					<p>In addition to out-of-pocket spending by individuals who purchase supplies at subsidized prices from private sector entities, an additional $44.2 million is incurred by the public sector to cover the subsidy. In this analysis, we include this cost within the total public sector consumption costs.</p>

							<p>Total spending on supplies is estimated based on expenditures by public sector entities. Levels of public sector spending are averaged to minimize the inevitable fluctuations in annual spending level that occur as a result of the timing or size of procurement orders, and to leverage multiple data sources<span id="ref-rg1" class="inline-reference-marker">[1]</span> which provide estimates for different years.</p>
							<p>Public sector spending is divided into donors and governments. Donor funding includes a relatively small amount of spending by NGOs ($14.8 million, or 9%). Donor spending was calculated based on three years’ worth of data on donor spending (2016&ndash;2018) and four years’ worth of data on government spending (2014&ndash;2017).</p>
							<p>Government spending comprises data from 127 countries, which is 55 more countries than were available to us in the CGA 2018. In addition, we have improved estimates of government spending for some countries, most notably India. These new figures should not be interpreted as new or additional spending but rather spending that was previously unreported.</p>
							<p>We have also modified our definition of government spending to include basket funds and loans, two categories of funding source previously considered in 2016 and 2018 CGA reports as donor funding. This amounts to an additional $55 million of spending in the CGA 2019 now classified as government, instead of donor. This reclassification of spending from donors to governments, coupled with more recent data showing declines in donor spending means that our overall donor spending estimate for 2019 is lower than in CGA 2018.</p>

This was done based on data shared by DKT, PSI and MSI<span id="ref-rg9" class="inline-reference-marker">[9]</span> as well as publicly available data in the <a href="https://www.dktinternational.org/contraceptive-social-marketing-statistics/">Social Marketing Statistics</a> published annually by DKT. For each method, country specific market shares of subsidized product were calculated by dividing the volume of subsidized products provided by NGOs and SMOs by the CGA 2019 estimate of total private sector consumption. These calculations did not include the full set of services or products provided by NGOs and SMOs, but rather limited this to subsidized products that were ultimately provided through private sector channels.<span id="ref-rg10" class="inline-reference-marker">[10]</span></p>
							<p>Where possible, estimates were validated against other sources. For example, we found that our market share estimates largely aligned with the SHOPS Plus <a href="https://shopsplusproject.org/sites/default/files/resources/C%C3%B4te%20d%E2%80%99Ivoire%20Family%20Planning%20Private%20Health%20Sector%20Assessment_0.pdf">Family Planning Private Sector Assessment in Cote d’Ivoire</a> and their finding that &ldquo;[&hellip;] with the exception of condoms, inexpensive socially marketed products dominate the [private] contraceptive market, with shares as high as 90 to 100 percent.&rdquo;</p>

							<p>Different approaches were used to estimate consumption quantities for short-term versus long-acting and permanent methods. Users of short-term methods must consume multiple products each year to obtain a full year of coverage. By contrast, a most users of implants, IUDs, and sterilizations will have no need to consume any supplies in the current year. Based on average duration of use the CGA estimates the volume of LAPM supplies that users will consume each year.</p>
							<p>Consumption quantities were attributed to either the public or private sector, with the private sector further subdivided into subsidized and non-subsidized, based on the user estimates by sector described above.</p>
							<p>Please note that consumption quantities are different from procurement volumes bought by institutional purchasers, which may be above or below the quantities needed for user consumption.<span id="ref-rg21" class="inline-reference-marker">[21]</span></p>

The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Mountains are so simple, they're hard. Learn when to stop. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here.</p>
				<p>They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. You can spend all day playing with mountains. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. Let your imagination be your guide. You can get away with a lot.</p>
